6.11 - Scanning images with an Admission Controller 

An admission controller intercepts requests to k8s api before they can do changes in order to approve or deny them. 

The ImagePolicyWebhook admission controller sends a request to an external webhook containing info about the image being used. 

The external webhook can approve or deny the request to create a pod with that image, if there are severe vulnerabilities.
