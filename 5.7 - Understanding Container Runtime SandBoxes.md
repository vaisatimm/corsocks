5.7 - Understanding Container Runtime SandBoxes

It is a specilized container Runtime providing extra layers of process isolation and greater security. 

Use cases: when you need extra security --> untrusted workload whose origin is not verified. 
Use cases: workloads that don't need direct host access and will not mind to perfomance. 
Use cases: multi-tenant, if you have outside users or customers who have the ability to run workloads in your cluster. 

COST OF PERFORMANCE!

### Software implementing Sandboxes: gVisor/runsc 

gVisor: ""Linux application kernel" that runs within the host OS, offering an additional layer of isolation between the host OS and containers:
It is a simulated kernel running inside the kernel itself. This means that gVisor wrap the container with an additional security layer. 

runsc is basically the executable that access the actual container runtime itself. 
runsc is an oci-compliant container runtime that integrates gVisor with applications like K8s

### Software implementing Sandboxes: Kata Containers 

Provide an additional layer of isolation by transparently running containers inside lightweight virtual machines. 
Instead of a simulated kernel running inside the kernel we have an actual virtual machine.
