7.2 - Understanding behavioral analytics

After an attack has occurred, we have to able to do a post-mortem analysis. 

We have to observe abnormal and potentially malicious events, through an OpenSource tool called: FALCO, by Sysdig. 

Falco monitors Linux system calls at runtime and laerts on any suspicious activity based upod configurable rules. 

Falco looks at: 
- Privilege escalation;
- File access: reads or writes to files at well-known locations like /, /usr/bin, etc.
- Binaries: execution of suspicous binaries such as opening a shell.
