5.11 - Understanding Pod-toPod mTLS

In order to avoid an attacker listening between our pods we can use mTLS: mutual transport layer security. 

Both parties fully authenticate each other and all the communication are encrypted. 

in mTLS both client and server both have a certificate to authenticate each other. 

If you have many pods, each one will need to have N-1 other certificates for the mTLS. 

K8s certificates help us a bit: Kubernetes API allows you to obtain certificates which you can use in your applications. 

These certificates are generated from a central certificate authority (CA).

You can programmatically access the certificates using th API.
