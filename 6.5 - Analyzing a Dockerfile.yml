6.5 - Analyzing a Dockerfile

Static analysis: is the process of looking at the source code or configuration to identify potential security issues. 

One way to harden the security of your images is to analyze the dockerfiles used to create images. 

Things to pay attentions: 

1 - User root: the final user to use in the final step where you choose the user will run the container at the end should not be root. 
2 - latest Tag: you should not use the tag latest because an attacker could have uploaded a new version of the image with some malicious code,
so you should always refer to a tag you trust. 
3 - unnecessary software: no unneded software that could be vulnerable and could extend the surface of attacks. 
4 - sensitive data: don't stores sensitive data inside a dockerfile, like passwords. 

### Example

FROM nginx:1.19.10

USER root

RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y wget
RUN useradd -ms /bin/bash nginxuser
ENV db_password=Mellon

USER root

ENTRYPOINT ["/docker-entrypoint.sh"]
EXPOSE 80
CMD ["nginx", "-g", "daemon off;"]

Let's correct: 

Change the final root user. 
Remove the installation wget line
Remove the password line.
The FROM line is ok since we are not using the latest tag. 

FROM nginx:1.19.10

USER root

RUN useradd -ms /bin/bash nginxuser

USER nginxuser

ENTRYPOINT ["/docker-entrypoint.sh"]
EXPOSE 80
CMD ["nginx", "-g", "daemon off;"]
